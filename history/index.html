<h2>The History of Japan is full of civil wars.</h2>
<p> The Sengoku period.During this period, although the Emperor of Japan was officially the ruler of his nation and every 
lord swore loyalty to him, he was largely a marginalised, 
ceremonial, and religious figure who delegated power to the Shogun, 
a noble who was roughly equivalent to a Generalissimo. 
In the years preceding this era the Shogunate gradually lost influence and control over the daimyo (local lords).</p>
<p> After nearly a century and a half of political instability and warfare, Japan was on the verge of unification by Oda Nobunaga, 
who had emerged from obscurity in the province of Owari (present-day Aichi Prefecture) to dominate central Japan,
when in 1582 Oda himself fell victim to the treachery of one of his own generals, Akechi Mitsuhide. </p>
<p>This in turn provided Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who had risen through the ranks from ashigaru (footsoldier) to become one of Oda's
most trusted generals, with the opportunity to establish himself as Oda's successor. 
Toyotomi eventually consolidated his control over the remaining daimyo and, 
although he was ineligible for the title of Seii Taishogun because of his common birth, ruled as Kampaku. </p>
