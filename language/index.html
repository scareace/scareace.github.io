<h2> Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana. The three main set of alphabets that Japan Uses</h2>
<p> kanji have more than one possible pronunciation (or "reading"), and some common kanji have many. 
Unusual or nonstandard readings may be glossed using furigana. Kanji compounds are sometimes given arbitrary readings for stylistic purposes. 
For example, in Natsume Sōseki's short story The Fifth Night, the author uses 接続って for tsunagatte,
the gerundive -te form of the verb tsunagaru ("to connect"),
which would usually be written as 繋がって or つながって. 
The word 接続, meaning "connection", is normally pronounced setsuzoku.</p>
<p> Some lexical items that are normally written using kanji have become grammaticalized in certain contexts, 
where they are instead written in hiragana. For example, the root of the verb 見る (miru, "see") is normally written with the kanji 見.
However, when used as a suffix meaning "try out", the whole verb is written in hiragana as みる, 
as in 食べてみる (tabetemiru, "try eating [it] and see"). </p>
<p> Katakana can also be used to impart the idea that words are spoken in a foreign or otherwise unusual accent; 
for example, the speech of a robot. </p>
<p> Several thousand kanji characters are in regular use. Each has an intrinsic meaning (or range of meanings), and most have more than one pronunciation, 
the choice of which depends on context. In modern Japanese,
the hiragana and katakana syllabaries each contain 46 basic characters, 
or 71 including diacritics. With one or two minor exceptions, each different sound in the 
Japanese language (that is, each different syllable, strictly each mora) corresponds to one character in each syllabary.</p>
