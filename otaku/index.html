<h2> Otaku Culture, an obssesive interests towards Japan's Anime and Manga</h2>
<p> TThe district of Akihabara in Tokyo, where there are maid cafes featuring waitresses who dress up and act like maids or 
anime characters,
is a notable attraction center for otaku. 
Akihabara also has dozens of stores specializing in anime, manga, retro video games, figurines, card games and other collectibles.
Another popular location is Otome Road in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. 
In Nagoya, students from Nagoya City University started a project on ways to help 
promote hidden tourist attractions related to the otaku culture to attract more otaku to the city.</p>
<p>Otaku often participate in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. 
Anime and manga otaku are the subject of numerous self-critical works, like Otaku no Video, 
which contains a live-interview mockumentary that pokes fun at the otaku subculture and 
includes Gainax's own staff as the interviewees.</p>
