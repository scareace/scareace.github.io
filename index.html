<h2> Welcome. To a website dedicated to learning all about the Nation of Japan</h2>
<p> The Land of the Rising Sun.</p>
<p> The English word Japan possibly derives from the early Mandarin Chinese or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the Japanese name, 日本, 
which in Japanese is pronounced Nippon About this sound listen (help·info) or Nihon About this sound listen (help·info). 
Japanese people refer to themselves as Nihonjin (日本人?) and to their language as Nihongo (日本語?). </p>
<p> From the Meiji Restoration until the end of World War II, the full title of Japan was Dai Nippon Teikoku (大日本帝國?), 
meaning "the Empire of Great Japan". Today the name Nippon-koku or Nihon-koku (日本国?) is used as a formal modern-day equivalent; 
countries like Japan whose long form does not contain a descriptive designation are 
generally given a name appended by the character koku (国?), meaning "country", "nation" or "state". </p>
